# The New Ukrainian Generation: Forged in Fire, United in Resolve

## The New Ukrainian Spirit

This generation of Ukrainians will redefine the future of their country. It is a moment synchronous with that of America in WWII where after it had been attacked, the entire country from coast to coast united for the war effort and the idea of what it meant to be American had risen to everyone's mind. Keep in mind Ukraine is one of the largest countries in Europe and you'll find different influences in its culture and language across oblasts (regions). This diversity could be seen as a threat as cultures, religions, and values slightly differed across Ukraine. Russia had assumed it could widen these differences to break Ukraine apart. Far from being the 'weakened' nation that Russia perceived, Ukraine has shown extraordinary resilience. In a narrative that echoes America's collective mobilization during WWII, Ukraine has united like never before. From professionals to farmers, the elderly to children, everyone has rallied to support the Ukrainian Armed Forces in myriad ways—be it weaving camouflage nets, crafting Molotov cocktails, or delivering vital supplies. 

## Forged in Fire

The men and women fighting on the front lines are enduring unimaginable hardships, losing friends and facing relentless enemy attacks. Yet, it is this crucible of suffering that is forging a new Ukrainian spirit—a spear aimed at the heart of Russian imperialism. Russias intentions is to take over Ukraine and use it as a platform to amplify its power.  US support allows Ukrainians to defend against the weaponry that Russia has been building for decades, and the men that they send as cannon fodder, many of which are either from what are considered colonies or pulled from prisons.

## A Pivotal Moment in History

This moment will be referenced for decades to come and though there are many lessons to be learned, the essence is whether the world allowed the destruction and let its will to spend and invest their resources to help Ukraine win its independence and protect the idea that we are all allies, those that live in a world with freedom and democratic values. Where you can vote and actually have unpredictable outcomes. Can you guess when Russia will have another president? I wager when Putin is no more.

## The chance for a bright future
Ukraine's future can be bright, it can enter a European alliance that will lower the barriers for trade, it can bolster its industrial and agricultural sectors, make jobs available for a technologically skilled labor force, and secure its democracy. This is supported particularly by military support that diminishes Russia's ability to wage terror upon Ukrainian civilians. The Ukrainian military, supported by a civil society and people around the globe, has achieved incredible results using technology they've never had access to. It is a remarkable event to see individuals with such a powerful will adapt and innovate to protect everything they love. There is no question this transition will be difficult, corruption will be the parasite from within that needs to be extracted.

## The risk of dissolving resolve
The other paths for Ukraine would be a generation conflict between Ukraine and Russia, a magnitude larger than the conflict between Israel and Palestine or Iran. A tragedy that would ruin especially Ukraine but Russia's prospects as well. Russias goal is to wait out Western support for Ukraine, and instill chaos abroad with its partners like Iran and North Korea. If this unity and aid to Ukraine diminishes it would be a disgrace and a defeat for justice. It is clear that Western alliances are far stronger but the resolve might not be as steadfast.
