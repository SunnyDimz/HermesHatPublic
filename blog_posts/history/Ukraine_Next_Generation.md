# The New Ukrainian Generation: Forged in War, United in Resolve

## The Night That Changed Everything

On the night of February 24th, as I was scrolling through Twitter, the impending doom became a grim reality: Russian tanks had crossed into Ukraine. Like countless Ukrainians worldwide, I'll forever remember what I was doing at that pivotal moment. Just two nights before, I had written about the horrors of the Holodomor and the suffocation of Ukrainian identity under Soviet rule. That night, it became clear: this was another existential battle for the soul of Ukraine.

## America's Relationship with Post-WW2 Soviet Union

All Americans should be aware of the relationship between the USA and the Soviet Union post-WW2. The Soviet Union was given dominion over all of Europe east of Berlin, creating the Iron Curtain. Generations suffered as a result, particularly in Ukraine where life was marked by food rationing, political repression, and cultural erasure. For further context, see the [Library of Congress Archives](https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/intn.html).

## The Crumbling Soviet Union and Ukrainian Independence

In the 1990s, many republics began to march for independence from the USSR, with Ukraine's declaration causing the Soviet Union's ultimate collapseâ€”an event Putin considers the worst in Russian history. For his perspective, witness his [2005 speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTvswwU5Eco).

## The Question of Resources and Security

After the fall of the Soviet Union, questions arose about the allocation of resources among the new republics. Ukraine, holding the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal, agreed to disarm under the [Budapest Memorandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum) in exchange for territorial security from the UK, the USA, and ironically, Russia. Despite this, Putin later invaded and annexed Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine.

## The New Ukrainian Spirit

It might be tempting to view the international solidarity behind Ukraine as miraculous. However, such a view diminishes the efforts of countless individuals, from President Zelenskiy to everyday supporters. Cracks are appearing in this unity, especially in the American political landscape. The choices we make now will reverberate for generations.
