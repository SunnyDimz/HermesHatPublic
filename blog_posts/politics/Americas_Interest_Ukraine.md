# America's Duty and the Future of Ukraine: A Crossroads in Western Unity

## America's Responsibility

America has a moral and strategic imperative to support Ukraine in its existential fight for survival against Russian aggression. The evidence is stark, as witnessed in various Ukrainian cities like Bucha, Bakhmut, and Avdiivka.

## The Legacy of the Iron Curtain

Understanding America's role requires a look back at its complex relationship with the Soviet Union post-WW2. The Iron Curtain that descended upon Europe led to decades of suffering, especially in countries like Ukraine where freedom was systematically repressed. For further insights, the [Library of Congress Archives](https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/intn.html) provides a detailed account.

## The Collapse of the Soviet Union and Ukraine's Role

In the 1990s, republics within the Soviet Union began to clamor for independence. Ukraine's pursuit of freedom in 1991 was a crucial factor in the dissolution of the Soviet Unionâ€”a development that Putin considers the worst moment in Russian history. For more, watch Putin's [2005 speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTvswwU5Eco).

## The Budapest Memorandum and Broken Promises

Post-collapse, Ukraine found itself with the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal. To ensure global stability, the [Budapest Memorandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum) was signed in 1994. Despite these promises, Putin invaded Crimea and other regions of Ukraine two decades later, effectively nullifying the agreement.

## The Fragility of International Solidarity

While the international support for Ukraine might appear miraculous, it is the result of tireless efforts from individuals across the globe. However, this unity is showing cracks, particularly within the American political sphere. The choices we make today will resonate through history, impacting Western unity and global stability.

## Questions

Will Western unity strengthen? Falter? The stakes have never been higher.
