# America's interest in Ukraine

## The Legacy of the Iron Curtain

Understanding America's role requires a look back at its complex relationship with the Soviet Union post-WW2. The Iron Curtain that descended upon Europe led to decades of suffering, especially in countries like Ukraine where freedom was systematically repressed. For further insights, the [Library of Congress Archives](https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/intn.html) provides a detailed account. It was America's vital influence on the world due to its technological innovation and economic power that had pressured the Soviet Union to its ultimate collapse. The peak of this pressure was laid down by Ronald Reagan who took a strong stance in his foreign policy against Soviet repression and violence. Many of my family members greatly remember his speeches and jokes he made. These joke stories highlighted the absurdity of the Soviet system, like how it took years to purchase a vehicle.

## The Collapse of the Soviet Union

The Soviets internal foundation was crumbling and in the 1990s many republics began to demonstrate and march for independence from the USSR, Lithuania and the Baltic states being the first. in 1991, however, when Ukraine followed suit it resulted in the total disintegration of the Soviet Union. Ukraine's pursuit of freedom in 1991 was a crucial factor in the dissolution of the Soviet Unionâ€”a development that Putin considers the worst moment in Russian history. Keep in mind that he speaks of a free, just, and democratic Russia but from the way I see it they've had one president for over 2 decades (Putler was prime minister in 2008 where he had changed the laws of Russia so he could become president again). Some leaders in America had recognized the risk, [watch Senator McCane's take on Putin](https://youtu.be/HLAzeHnNgR8?si=u_-iVykjBEki0rv5)

## The Budapest Memorandum and Broken Promises

Post-collapse, Ukraine found itself with the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal. To ensure global stability, the [Budapest Memorandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum) was signed in 1994. Despite these promises, Putin invaded Crimea and other regions of Ukraine two decades later. Why did they invade? Why did they invade Chechnya and Georgia? Although Russia is the largest country in the world, its never enough. Their ambitions, roots from communism, are universal. Ukraine had signaled their intentions to ally themselves with Europe via trade deals and aspirations towards the EU. This does not align with Russia's ambitions, so having control over then Ukrainian President Yanukovich, the [trade deals](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/21/ukraine-suspends-preparations-eu-trade-pact) with Europe were squashed and new ones signed with Russia. This triggered the [Maidan Revolution](https://youtu.be/V7e6B64Iqqg?si=2COccak6AANH6maz).

## Russias Invasion in 2014
Little Green Men walked thru into Ukraine and started waging war in the Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts. Crimea was annexed, Ukrainians were killed, villages were shelled. What was the Western response? A slap on the wrist with a few sanctions and not much else. After Russia had achieved its goals and Ukraine not having enough power to do anything about it, a ceasefire and treaty was signed in the [Minsk agreements](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/what-are-minsk-agreements-ukraine-conflict-2022-02-21/). In traditional Russian fashion, the ceasefire was broken within a day.

## Fight For Survival

The night of February 23rd I was doom scrolling thru Twitter to read updates on events near the Ukraine-Russia border when it was clear that Russian tank columns had begun rolling thru the border. Many across the globe had been warning of this event for months and it has finally come. My mind had iterated a million scenarios of what would happen, all included the death and destruction of Ukrainians and their cities. But as I had iterated before, Ukrainians would resist. Fortunately this time the USA had prepared in advance alongside some European partners to arm Ukraine with anti-tank and anti-air weapons. This enabled Ukrainians to fight back and stop Russian columns that wound up short of fuel and trapped, becoming scrap metal quickly. 

## International Rally For Ukraine
An immediate worldwide reaction to the invasion and the horrors that had been spread all over media sources sent more weapons and other aid to Ukraine. While the international support for Ukraine might appear miraculous, it is the result of tireless efforts from individuals across the globe. Individuals sharing videos, raising funds, delivering supplies, an entire virtual army that rally support for Ukraine. The videos of dead civilians, stories of torture and rape, the utter desolation of some villages on the front line incite a reaction from anyone who refuses to ignore it. I admire a line from Stephen Kotkin, a fellow at the Hoover Institution, "Ukrainian bravery plus Russian atrocities = Western Support". This has held true for now, however, this unity is showing cracks, particularly within the American political sphere. The situation is clear, the question is will the world and those that can do something to change the outcome, to punish those that commit evil acts en masse, to strive for justice and for liberty maintain their resolve and unity?
