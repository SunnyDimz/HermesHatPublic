# Understanding the Natural Rate of Interest and Its Impacts

## Introduction

The natural rate of interest plays a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of modern monetary policy. Representing the equilibrium interest rate where money supply meets demand, this rate is indispensable for central banks aiming to set effective policy rates.

## Historical Perspective on Interest Rates

Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, interest rates were influenced by a variety of global events and economic policies:

- **Oil Shocks and Volcker Rule**: The 1970s were marked by oil shocks which led to disruptions in global economies, resulting in stagflation in many Western countries. Central banks responded by raising interest rates to control inflation. The early 1980s saw Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker's aggressive interest rate hikes to combat inflation, resulting in a recession but eventually curbing inflation.

- **The Great Moderation**: Spanning from the mid-1980s to 2007, this period was characterized by reduced economic volatility, attributed by some to improved monetary policy and by others to structural economic changes. [Delve into the Great Moderation](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/great-moderation)
The Great Moderation and liquidity traps are closely related. During periods of low volatility like the Great Moderation, central banks may find themselves in a liquidity trap, a situation where traditional monetary policy tools lose efficacy due to very low interest rates. In such cases, any rate cuts intended to stimulate the economy might be less effective. This becomes a significant concern when the central bank needs to fight off negative economic shocks. From this point of view, a higher interest rate that manages a low unemployment rate allows more effective action from Monetary Policy.

## The Paths Forward
**Impacts on Different Demographics**
In line with Keynes' "euthanasia of the rentier," higher interest rates could significantly affect those who rely on fixed income or passive investments. While higher rates benefit savers, they could be detrimental to borrowers and can also impact housing markets, thereby affecting a broad range of demographics. [Euthanasia of the Rentier](https://mises.org/wire/keynes-and-euthanasia-rentier)

**Banking Mini-Crisis and Corporate Consolidation**
The steep rate hike regime had a larger impact for banks with heavy allocations to Treasury and Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS). The value of these assets sunk significantly, affecting the balance sheets of these banks to the point of insolvency, with a potential to trigger a bank run. News spreads lightning fast, some anxious depositors begin pulling out money which triggers the vicious circle towards insolvency. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation took unprecedented action in extending its insurance protection to all of the depositors at the affected banks, SVB and Signature Bank. Their justification was that the collapse of a few of these mid-sized banks could result in signficant losses for other financial services firms, sending an already fickle economy into the all-so dreaded and discussed recession. The actions, taken alongside the Fed's cash loans, received an uproar of moral hazard monitors. So far, it seems the policies have had their intended impact but it would be foolish to dismiss further repercussions.

## Insights from Renowned Economists

1. **John Maynard Keynes**: Beyond advocating for government spending, Keynes might have discussed the "euthanasia of the rentier". This concept, especially relevant in today's digital age, critiques profits earned through passive investments. [Euthanasia of the Rentier](https://mises.org/wire/keynes-and-euthanasia-rentier)

2. **Milton Friedman**: Recognizing the importance of money supply, Friedman's natural rate hypothesis suggests long-term growth is largely insulated from monetary policy. [Friedman's Monetary Theory](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2014/03/basics.htm)

3. **Friedrich Hayek**: Hayek's views on knowledge dispersion underscore the limitations of centralized economic interventions. Hayek was renowned for scorning centralized power in government or central banks because of the moral hazard. His most famous work, The Road to Serfdom, gained praise for articulating the threats of strong central control and their adverse affects on liberal societies.[Hayek's Economic Theory](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Hayek.html)

## Conclusion

We have all felt and will continue to feel the impacts of rising rates. The Feds balancing act seems to be working out so far, but they have already made it all but certain that rate hikes will continue. While the unemployment rate remains low, labor participation rate is still recovering from the COVID shock. Personal Saivng rate? (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT#0)
elevated debt levels with higher interest rates mean more expensive debt burden. The current administration and popular policies of some is to increase taxes, particularly on the upper class. Government increasing taxes increases the power of the rentier, if we take government as a rentier, of enabling desired outcomes from citizens.
